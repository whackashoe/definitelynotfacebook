definitelynotfacebook
=====================

A service to contact others via pgp. You are able to read your messages by entering in your public key, and able to send messages to others by entering in their public key and an encrypted message.

Non trusting design, everything must be encrypted as everything is public. 

Designed to leak no meta data. To run on tor hidden services. You can view a demo here: http://hfzcrftuhbg7jaml.onion

Very open to pull requests and feature requests! Happy hacking.
